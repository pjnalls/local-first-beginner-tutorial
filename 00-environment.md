*Concepts you may want to Google beforehand: mac, linux, windows, nodejs, nvm, expo, expo go, ios, android studio*

**Goal: Install the software required for this tutorial.**

I'm working on a Mac, though this tutorial should work on Linux or Windows machines as well.

[Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your computer (I recommend using nvm, a Node Version Manager) and either [install Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on an iOS and/or Android mobile device(s) **_or_** setup an [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) and/or an [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) you'll be using for testing.
